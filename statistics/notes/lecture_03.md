# Lecture 03: Descriptive Statistics, Types of Descriptive Statistics

## Descriptive statistics - branch of statistics that focuses on summarizing and organizing data to describe its main features.

## Types of descriptive statistics
There are 3 main types of descriptive statistics:
- The distribution concerns the frequency of each value.
- The central tendency concerns the averages of the values.
- The variability or dispersion concerns how spread out the values are.

## Key concepts
1. **A frequency distribution** describes the number of observations for each possible value of a variable. Frequency distributions are depicted using graphs and frequency tables.

2. **Measures of central tendency** estimate the center, or average, of a data set. The mean, median and mode are 3 ways of finding the average.

3. **Measures of variability** give you a sense of how spread out the values are. The range, standard deviation and variance each reflect different aspects of spread.


## Univariete descriptive statistics
Univariate descriptive statistics focus on only one variable at a time. It’s important to examine data from each variable separately using multiple measures of distribution, central tendency and spread. Programs like SPSS and Excel can be used to easily calculate these.

## Bivariate descriptive statistics
If you’ve collected data on more than one variable, you can use bivariate or multivariate descriptive statistics to explore whether there are relationships between them.

In bivariate analysis, you simultaneously study the frequency and variability of two variables to see if they vary together. You can also compare the central tendency of the two variables before performing further statistical tests.

Multivariate analysis is the same as bivariate analysis but with more than two variables.

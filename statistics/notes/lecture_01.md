# Lecture 01: Sample and population, methods for collecting a sample

**Population** is the entire group of individuals, items or data points that are the subject of a statistical study.

**A sample** is a subset of the population that is collected using a specific sampling method.

### Sampling methods

### *Simple Random Sampling*
This is the simplest and fairest way to collect a sample. Every individual in the population has an <mark>equal chance</mark> of being selected.
**Example**: 
+ Drawing names from a hat or using a random number generator to pick participants.

### *Stratified Sampling*
The population is divided into <mark>distinct</mark> subgroups or strata based on a specific characteristic (such as age, income level), and a random sample is taken from each stratum.

**Formula**:
$$
n_{h} = \frac{N_{h}}{N} \times n
$$

Where:
- \(n_h\) = the number of samples to be selected from the \(h^{th}\)
- \(N_h\) = the size of the \(h^{th}\) stratum
- \(N\) = total population size
- \(n\) = desired sample size

**Example**:
+ Interviewing people by picking the same number from each age group

### *Systematic Sampling*
Select every k-th individual from a list after choosing a random starting point. This method is simpler than simple random sampling when the population is ordered.

**Formula**:

$$
k = \frac{N}{n}
$$

Where:
- \(k\) = the sampling interval
- \(N\) = total population size
- \(n\) = desired sample size


**Example**:
+ Selecting every 10th customer who visits a store.

### *Cluster Sampling*

### *Convenience Sampling*

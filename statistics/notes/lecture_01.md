# Lecture 01: Sample and population, methods for collecting a sample

## Key concepts
**Population** is the entire group of individuals, items or data points that are the subject of a statistical study.

**A sample** is a subset of the population that is collected using a specific sampling method.

**Sampling methods** â€“ Techniques used to collect samples from a population.

## Main characteristics of a good sample
### 1. Representativeness
**Representativeness** - the degree to which a sample accurately <mark>reflects</mark> the characteristics of the population.

### 2. Adequate size
**The size of the sample** is important for its <mark>accuracy</mark>. A sample that is too small might not show the full variety of the population, leading to wrong conclusions. A larger sample gives more information, which makes the results stronger and lowers the chance of error. However, the sample size should be practical, considering the time, cost, and resources available.

### 3. Randomness
**Randomness** - the absence of predictability in sample selection, ensuring fairness.

## There are two categories of sampling methods:

### Random Sampling methods
In these methods, every individual has an equal chance to be selected.

### Non-Random Sampling Methods
In these methods, individuals are not chosen randomly. Instead, they are selected based on convenience, judgment, or other criteria.

## Common Sampling Methods

### *Simple Random Sampling (Random)*
This is the simplest and fairest way to collect a sample. Every individual in the population has an <mark>equal chance</mark> of being selected.
**Example**: 
+ Drawing names from a hat or using a random number generator to pick participants.

### *Stratified Sampling (Random)*
The population is divided into <mark>distinct</mark> subgroups or strata based on a specific characteristic (such as age, income level), and a random sample is taken from each stratum.

**Formula**:

$$
n_h = \frac{N_h}{N} \times n
$$

Where:
- \( n_h \) = the number of samples to be selected from the \( h^{th} \) stratum
- \( N_h \) = the size of the \( h^{th} \) stratum
- \( N \) = total population size
- \( n \) = desired sample size

**Example**:
+ Interviewing people by picking the same number from each age group

### *Systematic Sampling (Random)*
Select every k-th individual from a list after choosing a random starting point. This method is simpler than simple random sampling when the population is ordered.

**Formula**:

$$
k = \frac{N}{n}
$$

Where:
- \(k\) = the sampling interval
- \(N\) = total population size
- \(n\) = desired sample size


**Example**:
+ Selecting every 10th customer who visits a store.

### *Cluster Sampling (Random)*
The population is divided into clusters, usually based on natural groupings such as geographical regions. Some clusters are randomly selected, and all individuals from these clusters are included in the sample. This method is often used when the population is large and widespread.

**Example**:
+ Surveying students from randomly chosen schools in a district

### *Convenience Sampling (Non-random)*
Convenience sampling is non-random method, becouse you select participants who are easiest to reach or accessible to you. While it is cost-effective and quick, it can lead to biased results since it doesn't ensure that all segments of the population are represented.

**Example**:
+ Surveying friends

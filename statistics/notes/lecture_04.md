# Lecture 04: Frequency Distribution Graphs, Types of Frequency Distribution, Frequency Distribution Curve

## What is Frequency Distribution in Statistics?
**A frequency distribution** is an overview of all values of some variable and the number of times they occur.

## Frequency Distribution Graphs
To represent the Frequency Distribution, there are various methods such as Histogram, Bar Graph, Frequency Polygon, and Pie Chart.

A brief description of all these graphs:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Graph Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Use Cases</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Histogram</td>
      <td>Represents the frequency of each interval of continuous data using bars of equal width.</td>
      <td>Continuous data distribution analysis.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bar Graph</td>
      <td>Represents the frequency of each interval using bars of equal width; can also represent discrete data.</td>
      <td>Comparing discrete data categories.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Frequency Polygon</td>
      <td>Connects midpoints of class frequencies using lines, similar to a histogram but without bars.</td>
      <td>Comparing various datasets.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Pie Chart</td>
      <td>Circular graph showing data as slices of a circle, indicating the proportional size of each slice relative to the whole dataset.</td>
      <td>Showing relative sizes of data portions.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Frequency Distribution Table
A frequency distribution table is a way to organise and present data in a tabular form which helps us summarize the large dataset into a concise table.

For example. let's say we have a dataset of students' test scores in a class.
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Test Score</th>
      <th>Frequency</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0-20</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>20-40</td>
      <td>12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>40-60</td>
      <td>22</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>60-80</td>
      <td>15</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>80-100</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Types of Frequency Distribution
There are four types of frequency distribution:

1.Grouped Frequency Distribution
2.Ungrouped Frequency Distribution
3.Relative Frequency Distribution
4.Cumulative Frequency Distribution

### Grouped Frequency Distribution
In Grouped Frequency Distribution observations are divided between different intervals known as class intervals and then their frequencies are counted for each class interval.
This Frequency Distribution is used mostly when the data set is very large.

- Example:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Class Interval</th>
      <tr>Frequency</tr>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>10-20</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>20-30</td>
      <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>30-40</td>
      <td>12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>40-50</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>50-60</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Ungrouped Frequency Distribution
In Ungrouped Frequency Distribution, all distinct observations are mentioned and counted individually.
This Frequency Distribution is often used when the given dataset is small.

- Example
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Value</th>
      <tr>Frequency</tr>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>15</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>25</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>30</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Relative Frequency Distribution
This distribution displays the proportion or percentage of observations in each interval or class.
It is useful for comparing different data sets or for analyzing the distribution of data within a set.

Relative Frequency is given by:

$$
\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{f}}{\text{n}}
$$

Where:
- f is frequency of event
- n is total number of events

- Example:
<table><thead></thead><tbody><tr><th style="width: 116.667px;"><span>Score Range</span></th><td style="width: 116.667px;"><span>0-20</span></td><td style="width: 116.667px;"><span>21-40</span></td><td style="width: 116.667px;"><span>41-60</span></td><td style="width: 116.667px;"><span>61-80</span></td><td style="width: 116.667px;"><span>81-100</span></td></tr><tr><th style="width: 116.667px;"><span>Frequency</span></th><td style="width: 116.667px;"><span>5</span></td><td style="width: 116.667px;"><span>10</span></td><td style="width: 116.667px;"><span>20</span></td><td style="width: 116.667px;"><span>10</span></td><td style="width: 116.667px;"><span>5</span></td></tr></tbody></table>
